# Weekly Meetings

* [14th September 2017](#date-14th-september-2017)


### Date: 14th September 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped GitHub user [@sulantha2006](https://github.com/sulantha2006) by reviewing and accepting his pull request to add MINC and PETPVC to Neurodocker, and I helped Mathias ([@mgxd](https://github.com/mgxd)) scan for the Voice study.

#### Who helped you this week?

Dorota ([@djarecka](https://github.com/djarecka)) helped me think of ways to test different versions of FSL with Neurodocker.

#### What did you achieve?

* Added features to Neurodocker to be able to generate Dockerfiles for Nipype, and fixed bugs.
* Drafted at least two potential workflows for Nipype testing on CircleCI.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Implementing a Nipype testing workflow.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Submit a job on openmind to train a neural network based on a semantic segmentation paper (I will add the citation soon). This should take several hours, but once this is done, it should be quicker to submit training jobs in the future.
* Implement a Nipype testing workflow on CircleCI, and submit a "work in progress" pull request to nipype.
